## Book Hooked

**Technologies Used:**
HTML, CSS, JavaSript, and jQuery

* Used the 'on click' event handler for each, the previous and the next button for the book image carousel.

* Used the .val() method to apply and grab the user's input and used another 'on click' event handler to search for their book.

* Used the Google Books API to search for the book's Title, Authors, Image, Ratings, Genre, and Description.

* CSS was used to place drop shadows, hover, and flexbox.

**App Goal**
The purpose of this app is to use the Google Books API to search for desired books and view its authors, book cover, ratings, and description.

**Unsolved Problems**
I tried to use local storage to create a bookshelf for users to save their favorite books, and books they want to read.
